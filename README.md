    This project allows users to explore the zones of the ocean by toggling between different screens based on keyboard inputs
    that are listed as follows:

    "1": The Sunlight Zone where users can see sharks and jellyfish among the coral reefs (see "sunlight.js")
    "2": The Twilight Zone where users can explore particle micro-organisms and add plankton (see "finalProjectTwilight.js")
    "3": The Midnight Zone where users can give the giant squid tentacles by clicking and drawing across the screen (see "midnight.js")
    "4": The Abyss Zone where users can explore the darkness with a mysterious brush
